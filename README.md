Currently Texas State Technical college is looking to change their cloud program for the fall of 2019. I have been asked by my good friend and cloud instructor at the college to help make some of the courses. 
This isn't an official task of mine yet. I plan to present my prograss in front of both cloud instructors and get their opinions on what I have so far in early Decemeber.
This repository is bare at the moment as I have just started making code, lessons, and course material. I expect this to grow a good amount by the end of this month.
